# Privacy Policy for Firewall Extension

**Effective Date:** April 27, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes the data handling practices for the "Firewall - Archive.md Link Extractor" browser extension (the "Extension").

## Data Collection and Usage

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Extension **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data whatsoever.**

The Extension's functionality is entirely self-contained:

1.  It reads the URL of your currently active tab **only when you explicitly click the extension icon.**
2.  It uses this URL to construct a corresponding URL for the `archive.md` service.
3.  It fetches the content from the `archive.md` URL.
4.  It parses this fetched content locally (either in the background script or an offscreen document, depending on the version) to find a specific link.
5.  It opens the found link in a new tab.

All processing occurs locally within your browser. No data about your browsing activity, the URLs you visit, the content you access, or any other personal information is sent to any external servers controlled by the developers of this Extension.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with the third-party service `archive.md` to fetch web page archives. Your browser will make direct requests to `archive.md` when the Extension fetches content. Please refer to the privacy policy of `archive.md` for information on how they handle data. The Extension itself does not send any data _to_ `archive.md` other than the URL being requested via standard HTTP requests initiated by your browser.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the extension's description or associated documentation.
